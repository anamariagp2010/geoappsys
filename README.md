We have developed an application called firelook, which uses satellite data from FIRMS (NASA) and ERA5 reanalysis (ESA) to facilitate the monitoring of forest fires, allowing environmental authorities in each country and the general public to have up-to-date information and access precise data for early warnings and the mitigation of these phenomena.

Additionally, firelook is a user-friendly tool for reporting fire outbreaks quickly and effectively, promoting environmental care within the community, and fostering cooperation with government control agencies.

This application has support in both English and Spanish, includes an environmental education section, and allows predictions of the behavior of reported fires within the next 24 hours.
